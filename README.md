# paper.css
> *Just becasue I felt like it*

`paper.css` is a simple *classless* CSS stylesheet, as in it's as plug-and-play as it can get.  
No fumbling with classes necessary, just `<link>` it and it'll do it's best :>

### Why?

I wanted something simple and pleasant to apply to some personal projects, which eventually turned into whatever this is after countless attempts of trying to pick a decent color palette and design language.

This was pretty much inspired off of [omg.lol's "Minimal" theme](https://cdn.cache.lol/profiles/themes/css/minimal.css), while not being entirely the same.
